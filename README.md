# Digital-Logic-Design-CS-203-Lab
Compilation of programs written as part of Digital Logic Design course
## Lab 1
### A C++ program that performs the following:
- single bit addition
- addition of two n bit numbers
- inverse of a number
- 2's compliment of a number
- subtraction of two n bit numbers
## Lab 2
### Performs 2 input and 3 input xor operation using structural and dataflow modelling
## Lab 3
### Implementation of 16 bit ripple carry adder and 16 bit carry lookahead adder
## Lab 4
### Implementation of logic tile and switch box which are used as building blocks in designing any kind of circuit design
## Lab 5
### Implementation of 8 to 1 multiplexer only using logic tiles and switch boxes
## Lab 6
### Implementation of 4 bit BCD adder, 8 to 1 multiplexer and 8 bit universal shift register only using logic tiles and switch boxes in the same design. The circuit is determined by memory files.
